# The queue

Where the work stands and what comes next — the file a fresh session reads
first, and the one a subagent never sees.

`CLAUDE.md` carries the rules and is inherited by every subagent spawn. This
file carries the **state**: which mechanics are done, what is in progress,
what is owed, and what to take next. It moved out of `CLAUDE.md` on
2026-08-25 (`docs/DECISIONS.md` entry 21) because a blind second reader
inherits `CLAUDE.md`, and a queue that narrates a mechanic's findings
contaminates the reader before the brief arrives. Nothing below may be quoted
back into `CLAUDE.md`.

Two sections, two cadences, and both **subtract**: what is done leaves this
file for `docs/JOURNAL.md`, which is where the story goes.

- **Where things stand** — the handoff. Rewritten from scratch at the end of
  every session: what landed, what is in progress, what is owed, what to
  take next, and anything that needs the user. About twenty lines. Its last
  line is the next session's opener, verbatim.
- **The queue** — the backlog, in dependency order. One entry per mechanic or
  piece of tooling. A struck entry is **one line and a pointer** — to its
  document, its audit, and its journal entry — never a paragraph; the moment
  a struck entry grows a paragraph this file is a changelog again, which is
  how `CLAUDE.md` reached 847 lines. An entry in progress may carry a short
  brief until it is taken.

## Where things stand

*Last verified 2026-08-26, after the who-8 panic and the cheap window.* The
commit this section was written against is the one that lands it; if
`git log` has moved well past it, trust the queue below and the journal
before trusting this.

**Last landed.** Two things, and both were smaller than billed while hiding
something larger.

- **The who-8 panic is fixed, and the fix is a bound, not a guard.**
  `Leaders::list` is `Leader[10]`; two independent places stop every object
  search at leader eight, so the original never asks a diplomacy question
  about gaia — it could not answer one, since `diplos` is `int[8]`. Nothing
  in RoN can attack an animal. `world::PLAYER_SLOTS`, `docs/ANIM.md` §6.1,
  five tests and five red breakages. Commit `d1f5be4`.
- **The window experiment was answered by a file already on disk, and the
  premise was wrong twice.** `[Start Game] WORLD=6` writes the 3600 cells
  with `DUMP_ALL=0` (run31's start dump has them), and no frame *inside* a
  window needs a `WORLD` block at all — `run_traced` stands the sim up from
  the start dump. So `[End Frame] WORLD=6` was never needed. Same seed,
  back to back: `DUMP_ALL` bought **5 frames for 249 MB**; the cheap window
  bought **301 for 207 MB** in less wall clock. `docs/ORACLE.md`, "The
  300-frame window". `tools/fuzz/run.sh` uses it now.

**The number that came out of it.** A control run — `scenario.py
--no-stage`, no cheats at all, window at **[1, 301)** — scores
**`survived = 1`**: player 1's `o 0` is 24 position units off on both axes
at frame 2, player 0's `o 1` by 10 at frame 4, and at frame 1 two of
player 1's units already hold an order the sim never issued. A heights
sibling for the same seed (`window.py stage 1 3`, six minutes) returns
**identical** coordinates, so this is the port and not the flat map that a
cheap window leaves behind.

**And run20 scores 1 as well**, on the tuned lobby, over frames 0–4. So
the number is *reproducible on two maps*, which is worth more than a
novel one — but the claim that nobody had compared sim-frame 1 before is
wrong, and was made here before it was checked. run20 has done it since
2026-08-25. What the cheap window buys is 300 such frames instead of 4,
for a fifth of the bytes.

Two leads came with it. **Only one of them is the fuzzer's**, and that
was settled by checking rather than assuming:

- **`rng: frame 0: ours 180 draws, the original's 195`** — 15 short, then
  4 *over* at frame 1. **Not a fuzzer finding.** run20 (the tuned lobby,
  on disk since 2026-08-25) reads **160 against 175 — the same 15** — and
  scores the same `ticks before divergence: 1`. That makes it a better
  lead than a map-specific one, because it is a *fixed* missing block
  reproducible on two maps; it just was not found by fuzzing.
- **`check_start_orders` fails on one citizen** — *`who 1 o 6`: we derived
  None, the log has 2001*. This one **is** the fuzzer's: the same check is
  `[ok]` on run20. `docs/AI.md` §9.3 does not generalise off the map it
  was built on.

**Then, in order:**

- **The frame-0 draw gap** (15 short, above) — **and it reproduces on
  run20**, so it can be worked without a new capture at all. It is the
  cheapest lead on the board, it is upstream of everything, and the trace
  names every draw site. Start there.
- **The frame-1 order two of player 1's units hold and the sim does not**,
  and §9.3's sixth citizen. Same run, same dump
  (`gamelog-fuzz-424242-early.txt`, with `-heights` as its sibling).
- **Item 23, the hand-back's inversion** — unchanged, cheap, unblocked,
  and now affordable to capture over hundreds of frames rather than three.
- Then the older backlog: the `LEADERDATA` and `CITY` widenings; a
  `find_target` block; run7's order stream under the trace; a mounted
  attacker; a caravan; `make_stuff` whole; `Leader::diplomacy`;
  `calc_gather` for non-flat buildings; `think_civilian_transport`.

**The thing this session earned.** Yesterday's note was *measure the oracle
before building a better one*. Today's is the same rule one step earlier:
**check whether the expensive setting is doing anything before pricing
it.** This file had budgeted a 300-frame window against 25 MB a frame and
concluded it was probably unaffordable. It costs 0.69, and the evidence was
a `grep -c who2` on a file that had been on disk for eleven hours. The
corollary, which cost a wrong claim in this very file before it was
checked: **run20 already compared frames 0-4 and already scored 1.** The
cheap window's gain is 300 frames instead of 4 for a fifth of the bytes,
not a first look - and a claim about what "nobody has ever done" is
exactly the kind that costs a `--diff` to test and nothing to make.

**Needs the user.** Nothing blocking. The ledger (`docs/audit/README.md`)
is unchanged; its widest marker is still **`sin_table@00a46a00`'s
second-quadrant branch**, with the in-process exhaustive comparison as the
settlement. When to spend a Fable batch is still open; this session's
judgement is still **not yet**.

**Opener (for an Opus session):** `proceed @docs/QUEUE.md — item 24, the frame-0 draw gap: 15 draws short on two maps (run20 reads 160/175, the fuzzed map 180/195). Needs no new capture. Find the missing block.`

## The queue

In dependency order. A default rather than a contract — take the next
unstarted one unless something has made a different order obviously better,
in which case say so and take that. The story of each struck item is in
`docs/JOURNAL.md`, "Lifted from the queue", under the same number.

0. ~~**Corrections from the second reading**~~ — done 2026-08-20. Each
   mechanic's `docs/<M>.md` ends with "Second reading — landed";
   `docs/audit/2026-08-20-*.md`.

6. ~~**The combat table's hardcoded half**~~ — done 2026-08-20.
   `docs/COMBAT.md` §15.2–§15.3, `crates/rondata/src/typesdump.rs`,
   `rondata --types`.
7. ~~**Orders**~~ — done 2026-08-21. `docs/ORDERS.md`,
   `crates/sim/src/orders.rs`, `docs/audit/2026-08-21-orders.md` (with its
   third pass).
8. ~~**The pathfinder**~~ — done 2026-08-23. `docs/PATHFINDER.md`,
   `crates/sim/src/path.rs`, `docs/audit/2026-08-23-pathfinder.md`; its open
   items in §10.

    `docs/INPUT.md`, `crates/rondata/src/input.rs`.
12. ~~**AI**~~ — done 2026-08-25, over nine sessions. `docs/AI.md`,
    `crates/sim/src/ai*.rs` and `bhs.rs`, `docs/audit/2026-08-25-ai.md`
    (four passes); landed under it: `docs/SYNC.md`, `docs/ANIM.md`,
    `tools/trace/`, the cheat channel, runs 7–21.
13. ~~**Differential fuzzing against the original**~~ — **Tier 1 kept**,
    decided 2026-08-26. `tools/fuzz/{scenario,seedini,ledger}.py` and
    `run.sh`; `tools/gamelog/console.py`; `docs/ORACLE.md`, "The channel's
    vocabulary, and what it cannot do", "`restart` from the channel wedges
    the game" and "The 300-frame window". The journal has the story.

    **The verdict, and it is not the one it was being judged on.** The
    ledger's `survived` column is 1, not hundreds, and the three findings
    it was credited with on the day were **audited the same day and two of
    them handed back**:

    - **The who-8 panic is not a fuzzer finding.** run31 — tuned lobby, no
      cheats, on disk a day earlier — panics identically on the pre-fix
      sim. What reached it was *stepping more frames*, not a new map and
      not a cheat.
    - **The frame-0 draw gap is not a fuzzer finding.** run20 is 15 short
      too.
    - **§9.3's sixth citizen is.** `check_start_orders` is `[ok]` on run20
      and fails on the fuzzed map: a rule built on one map that does not
      generalise. One finding, from **map variation**.

    **And zero findings came from the cheat staging.** All three surfaced
    at frames 0–2, before `scenario.py`'s first `add` at frame 200 could
    fire; the control shape issues no cheat at all. So what has earned its
    place is `seedini.py` (a new map per seed) and the early wide window.
    `scenario.py`'s random `add`/`resource`/`military` generator — the part
    that looks most like fuzzing — has produced nothing yet, and the next
    session should either point it at something it can reach or drop it.

    **The shape it settled into.** `FUZZ_STAGE=0` — no cheats, window at
    [1, 301) — is the measuring shape; the staged shape is the coverage
    shape. Its cost is 195 MB and ten minutes, plus six more for a heights
    sibling when a seed is worth one (`master_land_heights` is the only
    thing `DUMP_ALL` is still for, and a fuzzed map has no sibling to
    borrow it from).

    **What it still cannot do**, unchanged: reach what the channel cannot
    stage — no console command issues an order, so diplomacy beyond the
    verbs, the sea half until transports can be ordered, CtW and
    multiplayer stay out of reach. For those the reading is still the only
    evidence.
14. ~~**The sea half — transports and docks**~~ — done 2026-08-25.
    `docs/TRANSPORT.md`, `crates/sim/src/transport.rs`,
    `docs/audit/2026-08-25-transport.md`; run22 and `tools/gamelog/window.py`.
15. ~~**Armies**~~ — done 2026-08-25. `docs/ARMY.md`,
    `crates/sim/src/army.rs`, `docs/audit/2026-08-25-army.md`; runs 23–27,
    `tools/gamelog/runwin.sh`, `rngcmp.py`, `armyrecs.py`.
16. ~~**The group orders**~~ — done 2026-08-25, audited and applied
    2026-08-26, third pass (Fable, main thread) the same day.
    `docs/GROUPS.md`, `crates/sim/src/group.rs`,
    `docs/audit/2026-08-25-groups.md`; runs 28 and 29, and the whole
    `GROUPDATA` record in `rondata::diff`.
17. ~~**`Form::compute`'s slot table**~~ — done 2026-08-26.
    `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.4 and §15, `crates/sim/src/form.rs`,
    `docs/audit/2026-08-25-groups.md` ("Fourth pass"); the diff is
    `run29_s_navy_slot_table_is_reproduced_from_the_install_s_own_spacing`.
18. ~~**run29's `UNITS=3` half**~~ — done 2026-08-26. `scene_at`'s unit
    loader and `Log::dumps` in `crates/rondata`, `docs/ARMY.md` §11 and
    §18, `docs/GROUPS.md` §4.4, §6.4, §7 and §13, `docs/ORDERS.md` §4.1
    and §11.1, `docs/ORACLE.md`. Two of its four open items closed, one
    reassigned to item 20, one bug found in `engagement` and one in
    `find_leader`.
19. ~~**The move order's formation angle**~~ — **the adder landed
    2026-08-26** with item 22: `Sim::add_move_facing_order` carries
    `angle + (angles[i] << 24)` and the mirror, `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.6 step
    6 and §12's seam row, `docs/ORDERS.md` §8.4. What is left of it is the
    byte's **sign**, which no run can separate while every dumped group
    lays out in Line — folded into item 23's capture.
20. ~~**The human group move**~~ — done 2026-08-26. run30 and run31
    (`docs/ORACLE.md`), `docs/GROUPS.md` §4.4, §6.4, §6.6, §11, §12.1 and
    §13, `docs/ORDERS.md` §8.4 and §11.1; `tools/gamelog/live.sh`,
    `archive.sh`, `groups.py`. Four checks in `rondata::diff`, one in
    `sim::form`, one in `crate::gamelog`.
21. ~~**The 36-member table**~~ — done 2026-08-26. `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.8
    (new), §12.2 (new), §4.1, §4.4, §6.3 and §6.4;
    `Sim::group_add_keeping` and `Unit::o_up`/`o_down`,
    `GroupState::reorigin` and `Sim::group_refresh_order`,
    `Sim::group_find_leader_slot`. One check in `rondata::diff`, two in
    `sim::group`, five deliberate breakages.
22. ~~**The mirror's predicate**~~ — done 2026-08-26, **and no run was
    needed**. `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.3's new subsection, §12.3 (new), §4.1,
    §6.6 step 6, §12's seam table and §13; `docs/ORDERS.md` §3.2 and §8.4.
    `sim::group::reversing`, `Sim::unit_set_angle`,
    `Sim::hand_back_facing`, `Sim::add_move_facing_order`,
    `MoveOrder::facing`, and the `QUEUE_NEW` clear hoisted ahead of the
    layout. One check in `rondata::diff` and two in `sim::group`; five
    deliberate breakages, four red.
23. **The hand-back's inversion** — what item 22 left, and it is the
    narrow half of the run that entry had booked. `kill_current_order`
    writes `order.facing XOR reversing(leader.angle − order.angle)`, and
    run31's two kills catch the leader 10.6° and 6.3° off the dying
    order's angle, so the `XOR` term never fires; the listing at
    `5e3062`–`5e307b` is its only evidence. *Capture:* a `UNITS=3` +
    `GROUPS=1` window over a group ordered one way, turned **right
    around** while marching, then re-ordered. Set the formation to Refused
    or an Echelon in the same window and it also settles item 19's sign —
    `angles` is all zero in every run on disk, so nothing has separated
    `compute_form`'s subtraction from the order adder's addition.
    `docs/GROUPS.md` §13.
24. **The first frames, on a map we did not tune against** — the two
    leads the fuzzer's control run left, and the first entry that comes
    from a capture opened at sim-frame 1. Both live in the same pair of
    dumps: `gamelog-fuzz-424242-early.txt` with
    `gamelog-fuzz-424242-heights.txt` as its `--sibling`.

    - **The frame-0 draw gap, on two maps.** `rng: frame 0: ours 180
      draws, the original's 195` on the fuzzed map; **`160 against 175`
      on run20**, the tuned lobby. The same **15**, so it is one missing
      block and not a map accident — then frame 1 four *over* (49 against
      45) on one and one over (52 against 53) on the other. `tools/trace/`
      names every draw site; `tools/gamelog/rngcmp.py` and `draws.py` are
      the instruments. Needs no new capture: run20 has been on disk since
      2026-08-25.
    - **§9.3's sixth citizen.** `check_start_orders` fails on exactly one:
      *`who 1 o 6`: we derived None, the log has 2001* — and is `[ok]` on
      run20. The rule was built and confirmed on one map. `docs/AI.md`
      §9.3.

    Neither needs a new run. Both are `rondata --diff` on a dump that
    exists.

## How to maintain this file

- **End of session:** rewrite "Where things stand" from scratch — do not
  append to it — and update its banner. Write the session's entry in
  `docs/JOURNAL.md`. Strike a finished entry to one line and a pointer; its
  story goes to the journal, not here.
- **Start of session:** read "Where things stand", then the entry you are
  taking, then that mechanic's document. `CLAUDE.md` is the rules; this is
  the state; the journal is on demand.
- **Before a blind fan-out:** `grep -n <mechanic> CLAUDE.md`, and read the
  memory index — a subagent inherits both. If either names a finding the
  readers are meant to re-derive, move it here or to the journal first. The
  brief cannot undo what the system prompt already delivered.
- **Never** quote this file or the journal into `CLAUDE.md`, a subagent
  brief, a `.claude/agents/` definition, or a memory hook.
