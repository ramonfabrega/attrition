# The queue

Where the work stands and what comes next — the file a fresh session reads
first, and the one a subagent never sees.

`CLAUDE.md` carries the rules and is inherited by every subagent spawn. This
file carries the **state**: which mechanics are done, what is in progress,
what is owed, and what to take next. It moved out of `CLAUDE.md` on
2026-08-25 (`docs/DECISIONS.md` entry 21) because a blind second reader
inherits `CLAUDE.md`, and a queue that narrates a mechanic's findings
contaminates the reader before the brief arrives. Nothing below may be quoted
back into `CLAUDE.md`.

Two sections, two cadences, and both **subtract**: what is done leaves this
file for `docs/JOURNAL.md`, which is where the story goes.

- **Where things stand** — the handoff. Rewritten from scratch at the end of
  every session: what landed, what is in progress, what is owed, what to
  take next, and anything that needs the user. About twenty lines. Its last
  line is the next session's opener, verbatim.
- **The queue** — the backlog, in dependency order. One entry per mechanic or
  piece of tooling. A struck entry is **one line and a pointer** — to its
  document, its audit, and its journal entry — never a paragraph; the moment
  a struck entry grows a paragraph this file is a changelog again, which is
  how `CLAUDE.md` reached 847 lines. An entry in progress may carry a short
  brief until it is taken.

## Where things stand

*Last verified 2026-08-26, after item 22.* The commit this section was
written against is the one that lands it; if `git log` has moved well past
it, trust the queue below and the journal before trusting this.

**Last landed.** **The mirror's predicate** (item 22) — and the entry was
wrong about what it needed. It said a run was owed; the answer was in
run31's dump and in two documents that had never been read next to each
other. `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.3 has a new subsection and §12.3 is new.

- **`GroupData::facing` is a running flag, not a setting**, with four
  writers. `Unit::set_angle` toggles it whenever the group's **leader**
  turns by 90° or more — the ordinary source of a live group's `facing 1`.
  `Unit::kill_current_order` **assigns** the dying order's own
  `MoveOrder::facing` back onto it, inverted if the leader has since
  turned around.
- **The ordering is the whole finding.** `action_move_near`'s `QUEUE_NEW`
  clear runs at `70524f`, `compute_form` at `7053ec` — the clear is
  **first**. So the flag a layout reads is the *last layout's* answer, and
  never the march's. That is why run31's frame 328 lays out square with
  `facing 1` printed the frame before.
- **The old reading also read the wrong frame**: 204's own end-of-frame
  heading rather than 203's, and 204 is the one frame in the run where
  that cannot work.
- **Item 19 landed with it.** `Sim::add_move_facing_order` carries
  `angle + (angles[i] << 24)` and the mirror; `MoveOrder::facing` is a
  field with a reader now, on both sides.
- Six predictions over three clicks, all landing; the old model kept as
  the control in the same test, and it gets one of three wrong.

**Then, in order:**

- **Item 13, differential fuzzing** — unchanged, and now the entry with
  the largest leverage per hour by a distance.
- **Item 23, the hand-back's inversion** — the narrow run item 22 leaves,
  and it carries item 19's leftover sign with it. Cheap, and it does not
  block anything.
- Then the older backlog: the `LEADERDATA` and `CITY` widenings the
  army's readers named; a `find_target` block where two candidates sit
  within a multiplier of each other; run7's order stream under the trace;
  a mounted attacker; a caravan; `make_stuff` whole; `Leader::diplomacy`;
  `calc_gather` for non-flat buildings; `think_civilian_transport`.

**The thing this session earned.** A rule to put beside "the
implementation is the audit": **before booking a run, grep the dump you
already have, and grep the listing for every writer of the field you are
about to call frozen.** Item 22's entry claimed a grep had found the only
other writers of `facing`; it had found two air-only ones and stopped,
because the two that matter reach the field through a group pointer rather
than by name — the same trap `MoveOrder::facing` was already recorded as
having, where the read goes through an order vtable slot. And the
corollary: **a fact written in two documents and joined in none is not
established.** Both writers were on the page; the ordering that makes them
matter was on neither.

**Needs the user.** Nothing outstanding. The ledger
(`docs/audit/README.md`) is unchanged: its widest-reaching marker is still
**`sin_table@00a46a00`'s second-quadrant branch**. The simulation mirrors
the angle; the decompiler says the function does something else, and item
21's 900 rotated destinations are more evidence the mirror is right. That
primitive is under every heading, projectile and formation rotation in the
game, and this is the second time the same twenty lines have fooled a
reader through the decompiler — so the settlement is `llvm-objdump`, not
another decompile. This session is a third data point for that: two
`llvm-objdump` passes settled in minutes what a decompile had left
ambiguous for a day. Twenty minutes, and it does not block anything. When
to spend a Fable batch is still open.

**Opener (for an Opus session):** `proceed @docs/QUEUE.md — item 13, differential fuzzing: a seed writes the .cmd and the ini, drives the original through tools/gamelog/runwin.sh, runs rondata --diff, and appends seed + first divergent frame to a ledger`

## The queue

In dependency order. A default rather than a contract — take the next
unstarted one unless something has made a different order obviously better,
in which case say so and take that. The story of each struck item is in
`docs/JOURNAL.md`, "Lifted from the queue", under the same number.

12. ~~**AI**~~ — done 2026-08-25, over nine sessions. `docs/AI.md`,
    `crates/sim/src/ai*.rs` and `bhs.rs`, `docs/audit/2026-08-25-ai.md`
    (four passes); landed under it: `docs/SYNC.md`, `docs/ANIM.md`,
    `tools/trace/`, the cheat channel, runs 7–21.
13. **Differential fuzzing against the original** — proposed and agreed
    2026-08-25, not started. The three pieces exist and have each been run:
    `crates/sim/src/soak.rs` generates a scenario and an order stream from a
    seed; `rontrace.cmd` stages a scenario into the original from a file,
    inside the tick, unattended, and `!quit`s it cleanly (`docs/ORACLE.md`,
    "The cheat channel"); `rondata --gamelog <dump> --diff` scores a dump
    frame for frame. Wired together, every seed is a behavioural run, and
    the trace's blind list shrinks without anyone writing a scenario by
    hand. That is the whole argument, and it is why this is worth a queue
    entry rather than a remark. What is not yet true, in the order it has
    to become true:

    - **A map both sides carry.** The soak's world is flat and hand-built;
      the original needs a lobby and a map. Stage on run9's map, which the
      harness already loads from its `WORLD=6` dump, with the lobby seed
      fixed — a scenario is then "these types at these tiles, these orders
      at these frames" on ground both simulations agree about.
    - **A vocabulary bounded by the channel.** A scenario can contain only
      what the cheat channel can stage: a spawn by type at a tile, a
      selection, an order (move, gather, build, attack, garrison). Start
      with move, gather and attrition — the mechanics that already match
      frame for frame — and widen by the blind list, one family a time.
    - **An AI-free lobby, or the AI scored apart.** The original's AI runs
      unless the lobby has none (`-config`); run6's lobby is the template.
      With an AI in, its units are noise the diff must be told to skip.
    - **The dump is the whole cost.** ~3 frames a second at `UNITS=3`,
      ~500 with the per-frame dump gated off. A scenario is a window:
      fast-forward to it, dump one to three hundred frames, quit. Budget one
      to two minutes a seed, and run seeds in a batch overnight.
      `tools/gamelog/runwin.sh` is that window run, unattended, today.
    - **Definition of done:** a tool (`tools/fuzz/`, or beside
      `tools/gamelog/`) takes a seed, writes the `.cmd` and the ini, drives
      the game, runs the diff, and appends one line to a ledger — seed,
      first divergent frame, the functions the trace saw execute. The ledger
      is what `report.py … blind` reads next, and the first divergent frame
      is the score to move.
    - **What it cannot do**, said now so nobody expects it: reach what the
      channel cannot stage — diplomacy, the sea half until transports can
      be ordered, CtW, multiplayer. For those the reading stays the only
      evidence, and that list is the reading's brief.
14. ~~**The sea half — transports and docks**~~ — done 2026-08-25.
    `docs/TRANSPORT.md`, `crates/sim/src/transport.rs`,
    `docs/audit/2026-08-25-transport.md`; run22 and `tools/gamelog/window.py`.
15. ~~**Armies**~~ — done 2026-08-25. `docs/ARMY.md`,
    `crates/sim/src/army.rs`, `docs/audit/2026-08-25-army.md`; runs 23–27,
    `tools/gamelog/runwin.sh`, `rngcmp.py`, `armyrecs.py`.
16. ~~**The group orders**~~ — done 2026-08-25, audited and applied
    2026-08-26, third pass (Fable, main thread) the same day.
    `docs/GROUPS.md`, `crates/sim/src/group.rs`,
    `docs/audit/2026-08-25-groups.md`; runs 28 and 29, and the whole
    `GROUPDATA` record in `rondata::diff`.
17. ~~**`Form::compute`'s slot table**~~ — done 2026-08-26.
    `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.4 and §15, `crates/sim/src/form.rs`,
    `docs/audit/2026-08-25-groups.md` ("Fourth pass"); the diff is
    `run29_s_navy_slot_table_is_reproduced_from_the_install_s_own_spacing`.
18. ~~**run29's `UNITS=3` half**~~ — done 2026-08-26. `scene_at`'s unit
    loader and `Log::dumps` in `crates/rondata`, `docs/ARMY.md` §11 and
    §18, `docs/GROUPS.md` §4.4, §6.4, §7 and §13, `docs/ORDERS.md` §4.1
    and §11.1, `docs/ORACLE.md`. Two of its four open items closed, one
    reassigned to item 20, one bug found in `engagement` and one in
    `find_leader`.
19. ~~**The move order's formation angle**~~ — **the adder landed
    2026-08-26** with item 22: `Sim::add_move_facing_order` carries
    `angle + (angles[i] << 24)` and the mirror, `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.6 step
    6 and §12's seam row, `docs/ORDERS.md` §8.4. What is left of it is the
    byte's **sign**, which no run can separate while every dumped group
    lays out in Line — folded into item 23's capture.
20. ~~**The human group move**~~ — done 2026-08-26. run30 and run31
    (`docs/ORACLE.md`), `docs/GROUPS.md` §4.4, §6.4, §6.6, §11, §12.1 and
    §13, `docs/ORDERS.md` §8.4 and §11.1; `tools/gamelog/live.sh`,
    `archive.sh`, `groups.py`. Four checks in `rondata::diff`, one in
    `sim::form`, one in `crate::gamelog`.
21. ~~**The 36-member table**~~ — done 2026-08-26. `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.8
    (new), §12.2 (new), §4.1, §4.4, §6.3 and §6.4;
    `Sim::group_add_keeping` and `Unit::o_up`/`o_down`,
    `GroupState::reorigin` and `Sim::group_refresh_order`,
    `Sim::group_find_leader_slot`. One check in `rondata::diff`, two in
    `sim::group`, five deliberate breakages.
22. ~~**The mirror's predicate**~~ — done 2026-08-26, **and no run was
    needed**. `docs/GROUPS.md` §6.3's new subsection, §12.3 (new), §4.1,
    §6.6 step 6, §12's seam table and §13; `docs/ORDERS.md` §3.2 and §8.4.
    `sim::group::reversing`, `Sim::unit_set_angle`,
    `Sim::hand_back_facing`, `Sim::add_move_facing_order`,
    `MoveOrder::facing`, and the `QUEUE_NEW` clear hoisted ahead of the
    layout. One check in `rondata::diff` and two in `sim::group`; five
    deliberate breakages, four red.
23. **The hand-back's inversion** — what item 22 left, and it is the
    narrow half of the run that entry had booked. `kill_current_order`
    writes `order.facing XOR reversing(leader.angle − order.angle)`, and
    run31's two kills catch the leader 10.6° and 6.3° off the dying
    order's angle, so the `XOR` term never fires; the listing at
    `5e3062`–`5e307b` is its only evidence. *Capture:* a `UNITS=3` +
    `GROUPS=1` window over a group ordered one way, turned **right
    around** while marching, then re-ordered. Set the formation to Refused
    or an Echelon in the same window and it also settles item 19's sign —
    `angles` is all zero in every run on disk, so nothing has separated
    `compute_form`'s subtraction from the order adder's addition.
    `docs/GROUPS.md` §13.

## How to maintain this file

- **End of session:** rewrite "Where things stand" from scratch — do not
  append to it — and update its banner. Write the session's entry in
  `docs/JOURNAL.md`. Strike a finished entry to one line and a pointer; its
  story goes to the journal, not here.
- **Start of session:** read "Where things stand", then the entry you are
  taking, then that mechanic's document. `CLAUDE.md` is the rules; this is
  the state; the journal is on demand.
- **Before a blind fan-out:** `grep -n <mechanic> CLAUDE.md`, and read the
  memory index — a subagent inherits both. If either names a finding the
  readers are meant to re-derive, move it here or to the journal first. The
  brief cannot undo what the system prompt already delivered.
- **Never** quote this file or the journal into `CLAUDE.md`, a subagent
  brief, a `.claude/agents/` definition, or a memory hook.
