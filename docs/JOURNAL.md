# Journal

The chronicle: what each session did, dated, append-only. It is never the
opener — `docs/QUEUE.md` is what a session reads first — and it is never
inherited by a subagent, because it names the findings a blind reader is
meant to re-derive. What it is for is the yield story, which the mechanic
documents deliberately prune and git history carries badly: what a reading
found, what a run confirmed, what a diff overturned, and what each cost. It
is also the one document here that could one day be public, as the account
of how this was built.

Rules:

- One entry per session, dated, newest last, pointing at commits and
  document sections rather than restating them.
- Label a claim's status where the claim is — "observed in run16", "read,
  not yet run", "inferred" — never in a preamble. A chronicle reads as
  narrative, and a hedge stated once at the top is settled fact by the next
  reader.
- A struck queue entry points here; this file never points back at the
  queue.
- Never quoted into `CLAUDE.md`, a subagent brief, or a memory hook.

## Lifted from the queue, 2026-08-25 — by item, not by date

What follows is the working agreement's queue as it stood in `CLAUDE.md` on
the morning of 2026-08-25, lifted verbatim into `docs/QUEUE.md`
(`docs/DECISIONS.md` entry 21) and moved here the same day when the queue's
entries were cut to one line each. It is organised by queue item, and each
item's narrative runs session by session, oldest first. From the next
dated heading on, the journal is by date.

0. ~~**Corrections from the second reading**~~ — **done, 2026-08-20.** All six
   mechanics' audits under `docs/audit/` are landed; each document now ends
   with a "Second reading — landed" section, and each place a claim changed
   says so inline. The ones that changed observable behaviour: attrition's
   sixteenths-damage and bleeding wagons, production's library-only fan-out
   and research-that-trains-nothing, costs' redirect table, movement's
   unit-versus-body step. Done the way the next one should be: one worker per
   mechanic, each re-verifying every claim against the decompile before
   changing it, document first, then implementation and tests.
1. ~~**The tech tree**~~ — **done, 2026-08-20**, `docs/TECH.md` and
   `crates/sim/src/tech.rs`: `has_tech`, `get_preq`, `has_preq`,
   `type_eligible`, `type_avail`, `queue_here`, `gain_tech` with its cascades,
   `lose_tech`, `set_age`, the starting position, the lobby's start/end ages.
   The `TypeIndex` enum is now dumped whole by
   `tools/ghidra/scripts/DumpEnumAll.java`. Second reading done and landed
   (`docs/audit/2026-08-20-tech.md`): it found the loaders' derived fields —
   every combat unit implicitly needs its age's Military epoch — which a
   reading of the predicates alone cannot see. Read the loader too.
2. ~~**Combat**~~ — **done, 2026-08-20**, `docs/COMBAT.md`, `crates/sim/src/
   combat.rs` (the arithmetic), `fight.rs` (the attack step, targeting,
   projectiles, buildings) and `balance.rs` (the combat table's generation).
   The damage formula end to end, sixteenths delivery, the recharge cadence,
   accuracy/scatter/flight time/hit test/splash, the game's RNG, buildings'
   arrows, the target search and ranking. Second reading done and adjudicated
   (`docs/audit/2026-08-20-combat.md`). What it left as inputs: the nation,
   wonder and patriot modifiers, terrain flags, the `type_damage` lineage
   predicates that need a tree loader; what it left open: the flank direction
   convention (a behavioural check) and the `balance.xml` flag-row separator
   (the `RULES=1` log settles it).
3. ~~**Cities and buildings**~~ — **done, 2026-08-20**, `docs/CITIES.md`,
   `crates/sim/src/build.rs` (the type, the construction clock, the site's
   hit points, repair, refunds), `place.rs` (the tile layer and the
   `blocked_site` predicates with the original's `BlockIndex` verdicts),
   `city.rs` (the record, membership, the automatic level-up, capture,
   assimilation, the city heal, plunder, default-mode elimination) and
   `garrison.rs` (the FIFO chain, `can_garrison`, the `do_garrison` gates,
   one-squad-a-frame ejection, the garrison heal). Read by five readers in
   parallel, one per sub-area, and re-read blind the same way
   (`docs/audit/2026-08-20-cities.md`). Two of the first reading's claims were
   settled in the disassembly rather than the decompile — the argument
   `do_build` passes and the value `capture_strength` takes — which is the
   cheap move whenever the decompiler prints a local that cannot be right.
   What it left as inputs: the nation, wonder and tech layers (`city::Nation`,
   `build::BuildMods`/`ClockMods`/`HitsMods`), the per-wonder one-offs of
   `activate`, the AI branches, visibility, the capital-countdown elimination
   mode.
4. **The behavioural-check batch** — **run 2026-08-20, two sessions; the
   method is proven and the list is mostly closed.** What it took was finding
   the loggers' real switchboard (the ini values are per-category *detail
   thresholds*, `UNITS=3 BUILDS=6 CITIES=5` is the setting, `DUMP_ALL=1` is a
   different switch that hangs the game but is the only way to the type
   tables and `COMBATTABLE`), the chat-cheat vocabulary, the `~` console and
   its tile-coordinate mode, `-config`/`-automation` for the lobby, and the
   fact that `cheat select <o>` plus a right-click issues a normal order —
   which made every remaining check scriptable. All of it is one recipe in
   `docs/ORACLE.md`, "Running a check: the recipe in one place", with the
   scripts in `tools/gamelog/`.

   **Landed:** the construction clock, both halves — one builder is +100 a
   frame, two are +150, the clock re-bakes on a tech change for unstarted
   sites only (`docs/CITIES.md` §3.2–§3.3); the lobby start age grants no
   epochs, techs or pop cap (`docs/TECH.md`); a city is refused at exactly 24
   tiles and starts at 25, on two bearings, with the tower-site-first control
   that makes every other `blocked_site` verdict testable (`docs/CITIES.md`
   §2.6.2); the city heal, period 4 and one point per level (`docs/CITIES.md`);
   `UnitData.angle` is the facing, so the flank convention is settled at its
   premise — level 1 is the rear (`docs/COMBAT.md` §14.1, `docs/MOVEMENT.md`);
   the `balance.xml` separator, settled against the dumped table (see 6).

   **Still open, none blocking, each a 20–60 minute drive when the game is up
   for another reason:** the city mask's remaining three rungs (recipe in
   `docs/CITIES.md` §3.6); the garrison heal — no script path into a building
   found yet, the remaining route is `Build::train` + `cheat finish`
   (`docs/CITIES.md` §15); ~~the Nubian attrition step, which needs attrition to
   actually run (`docs/ATTRITION.md`)~~ — **done, run16, 2026-08-24: the
   clause is dead, by reading and by observation** (`docs/ATTRITION.md`,
   last section; the whole attrition/supply mechanic was observed in that
   run, every prediction holding); ~~the flank damage ratio~~ — **done,
   run17, 2026-08-24: 48/85/117 by damage, level 1 the rear
   (`docs/COMBAT.md` §16)** — for which
   `tools/gamelog/hits.py` is the instrument and one damage source on the
   target is the setup (`docs/COMBAT.md` §14.1); and, new from the
   `BUILDS=7` run, **`FARM_GROWS`** — the original re-targets a farmer at
   frame 102 against the documented ~200, which the harness's order diff
   measures for free on any `UNITS=3` dump (`docs/ORDERS.md` §6.5).
5. ~~**The data layer into the sim, and the diff**~~ — **done, 2026-08-20**,
   `docs/DATALAYER.md`, `crates/rondata/src/{gamelog,dump,load,diff}.rs`:
   the gamelog reader, the loader (364 units, 129 buildings, 628-entry tree,
   the combat table — every key resolved, by `TYPENAME`), and the harness
   (`rondata <install> --gamelog <dump> --diff`). The dump's `CONSTANTS`
   block checked 231 of 232 `Tuning::RON` slots against the program's own
   loaded values and classified the representation of all 716. Taken out of
   order, before 4, because the game window was on the user's screen; the
   harness's score is the expected ceiling (1 tick — no AI, no orders) and
   its next inputs are `DUMP_ALL=1` and an order stream. Two corrections
   landed on the way: XML *fields* are read by tag name from
   `internal_strings.xml` (records stay positional — `docs/FORMATS.md`), and
   `RULES=1` does not dump the type tables (`docs/ORACLE.md`).
6. ~~**The combat table's hardcoded half**~~ — **done, 2026-08-20**,
   `docs/COMBAT.md` §15.2, `crates/rondata/src/typesdump.rs` and
   `rondata --types <dump>`. The start-of-game dump's `COMBATTABLE` is the
   engine's own composed table, and its `UNITTYPE` blocks are the inputs —
   so the check compares both, the 364 `Kind`s field by field and then the
   364 × 364 block. It found three predicate errors, not thirty: the age one
   too low for 306 units (`get_age_slow` adds 1 to an age tech's `AGE`), four
   lineage roots keyed by a display name that was the wrong unit (`ECOMPANION`
   is *Royal* Companion), and `0x14000` misread as M|O where it is O|Q. With
   them landed **0 of 132,496 cells differ**, and the check is the
   regression guard from here. The `Flag_` rows are dead data (§14.9), landed
   with it. The building half followed the same day (§15.3): `combat::Table`
   is two-family, `rondata` builds a `Kind` per building, the fight path
   applies the table to every pair, and **all four quadrants of the
   493 × 493 are equal** — the one finding on the way was a building's
   domain, `BuildType::set_domain` from `BUILD_FLAGS b`.

7. ~~**Orders**~~ — **done, 2026-08-21**, `docs/ORDERS.md`,
   `crates/sim/src/orders.rs`: the order list and its three enqueue modes,
   one order stepped per frame, the move order end to end with the
   pathfinder as a named seam, build/repair/garrison through the swarm ring,
   the gather registration and the wood/ore machine, the attack order's
   reload gate and chase, the idle cadence, the start of a game, the spot
   search, the log format. Taken before AI because AI issues orders and the
   harness's score could not move without them. The blind second reading and
   all seven adjudications are landed (`docs/audit/2026-08-21-orders.md`),
   and so is the harness work: the start of a game in `build_sim` and the
   `UNITS=3` order blocks read back and diffed **every frame**
   (`docs/DATALAYER.md` §3.1). The intent diff earned itself immediately —
   six farm citizens holding `THINK` where the original holds `GATHER`, from
   frame 1, with both simulations agreeing on every position. The
   `BUILDS=7` dump that was blocking it **has been captured**
   (`gamelog-run6`, `docs/ORACLE.md`), `gather_from` and `orig_type` are
   read into the harness, and **a woodcutter's citizen now matches the
   original's position and order list for all 432 logged frames**. What
   still cannot move: the AI's units (they need the order stream) and the
   farmers, which part at frame 102 — the run's own finding, that
   `FARM_GROWS = 200` is wrong by about a factor of two (`docs/ORDERS.md`
   §6.5).
8. ~~**The pathfinder**~~ — **done, 2026-08-23**, `docs/PATHFINDER.md` and
   `crates/sim/src/path.rs`: `astar_path` on all three grids (greedy
   heuristic, LIFO tie-break, metric-keyed dedup, budgets, suspend,
   reconstruction), `calc_cost` with every term modelled or a named seam,
   the three wrappers with their pre-walks and post-processing,
   `invalid_loc` with the original's five flags, `do_move`'s planner wiring,
   and §4.6's march fixed point **settled** — the original recomputes the
   angle every step and clamps each axis, so the 2026-08-22 guard and its
   sync divergence are retired. `PathLength`/`PathTo` **score** now; on
   `gamelog-run6` the first woodcutter matches all 432 frames and the
   second's path stack matches for 427 (both pinned as tests). Every
   remaining path disagreement is player 1's units crossing **forest the
   flat harness world does not carry** — so the next path-diff win is
   world data (the map's tile layer into the harness), not search. Found
   on the way: flat gatherers' footprints were wrongly `BLOCKED`
   (`mask_me`'s template only blocks marked tiles), and the cost function
   clamps its additive term at zero, so the own-territory −4 only ever
   offsets danger. The blind second reading ran the same day and is landed
   (`docs/audit/2026-08-23-pathfinder.md`): 32 verdicts, the structure
   doubly confirmed, five behavioural corrections applied — among them
   `leaders.flags & 4` = `is_human` gating `army`/`worker` (which exposed
   the gamelog parser handing every leader its successor's flags — fixed),
   the pull-back walk's give-up exit, and the corner-cutting probe table,
   settled in the listing. Still open: `go_around_building`, collision
   recovery (`find_upath`'s caller), suspend/restore stashing, and the
   forest tile layer for the harness world (the remaining run6 path gap).
9. ~~**The recorded-game container**~~ — **done, 2026-08-24**,
   `docs/RECGAME.md` and `crates/rondata/src/recgame.rs`
   (`rondata --recgame <file.rcx>`). Taken out of order because the missing
   piece arrived from outside: the container was derived in ORACLE.md Part 1
   but deliberately left unimplemented until a file existed, and
   heavengames' downloads section (user link, ~245 recorded games) supplied
   the one explicitly EE-era sample. The full header walk (`Game::walk_data`
   → `GameInfo::walk_data`, three wire primitives), the random-game blob
   (playback reads it and frees it unused), the embedded rules, and the
   package stream to EOF. Found on the way: **a recording embeds the loaded
   rules tables**, and the sample's composed 493×493 combat table equals
   ours **cell for cell across a seven-year build gap** — so any recording
   is now the combat-table ground truth, replacing the `DUMP_ALL` run that
   hangs the game. The blind second reading ran the same day and is landed
   (`docs/audit/2026-08-24-recgame.md`): the 943-byte header map identical
   in both readings, the package-stream start proven unique by a backward
   DP at the landmark's exact byte, and three corrections adopted — the
   file is written raw and gzipped only in `finalize` (sniff `1f 8b`), the
   marker is the insensitive hash's low byte, and the Types stretch is
   readable in principle but provably needs the loader's `types.list`
   order. What it leaves open: ~~the command payload encoding~~ (done, see
   10), the 806 per-type rules walkers (skipped by a package-validated
   landmark), and ~~recording a fixed-seed game on *this* install so order
   stream and gamelog describe the same run~~ — **done, see 12**.
10. ~~**The command payload encoding**~~ — **done, 2026-08-24**,
    `docs/COMMANDS.md` and `crates/rondata/src/commands.rs`. The full
    dispatch table (`CommandPackage::process`, 0x00–0x51, 82 commands),
    every wire layout from the PDB's `*Command` structs (packed from +0x1,
    doubly derived — decode-side `process_*` returns and encode-side
    `issue_*` sizes agree everywhere), the four variable-length encodings,
    the selection model (a `group` command sets the package's selection,
    `num = 0` meaning "same as last"), and the MP-only obfuscation
    (seed-keyed u16 XOR in `CommandPackage::send` plus seeded
    `Random::get(0,2)` padding gaps) — single-player recordings are plain,
    and the turn pump shows recordings store packages *pre-decode*.
    Verified in one shot: all 21,884 payloads of the heavengames sample
    decode with zero errors to exact size (25,779 commands — a camera
    command per frame, the rest a 23-minute game's real input), pinned as
    an install-gated test and a histogram in `rondata --recgame`. The
    blind second reading ran the same day and is landed
    (`docs/audit/2026-08-24-commands.md`): the table re-derived
    identically, four corrections adopted — `console_cmd` physically
    cannot be sent (0x209 > the 512-byte cap), the save-game walker
    serialises `group` where the recording head does not, five commands
    are dispatched but provably never emitted, and the `valid` flag is a
    free SP/MP fingerprint. What it leaves open: an MP sample to exercise
    `decode_mp`, and `marwan`'s semantics.
11. ~~**The recorded order stream into the harness**~~ — **done,
    2026-08-24**, `docs/INPUT.md`, `crates/rondata/src/input.rs`, and
    `rondata --recgame <file> --gamelog <dump> --diff`. Taken out of order
    because it was the one item on the queue that needed the game running
    and a person at the keyboard. **The paired run exists**:
    `gamelog-run7-ancient-nubian-orders.txt` and `Playback - 2026.08.24
    10'15'53 (Mon).rcx` — 1,732 frames and 1,732 packages of the same game,
    same lobby as run6 so the only variable is that this one has input in
    it. Feeding it turns `Length { ours: 0 }` and `Kind { ours: 7 }` into
    path-level disagreements on the three units the stream names, i.e. the
    orders now exist and match in kind. Found on the way: **recording was
    already switched on** (`prefs & 0x1000000`, the Options → Game
    checkbox), so fourteen `.rcx` files of earlier sessions were already on
    disk; **gzip is the clean-quit fingerprint** (`finalize` is the only
    repack, and the two gzipped files are exactly the two runs quit through
    the menu, thirteen raw ones exactly the killed runs — the second
    reading's correction confirmed against fifteen files at once); and
    **the path stack's goal is the un-snapped click, not the snapped
    destination** (§7, evidence in the dump, deliberately not implemented —
    it is a pathfinder change and belongs with the pathfinder's pins).
12. **AI** — last, because it is the largest and the least oracled.
    ~~and better oracled once 4, 5 and the pathfinder stand~~ — still true,
    but **the reason it is last has changed and it is now blocking**. No AI
    class issues a command (`docs/INPUT.md` §1: every `issue_*` caller is a
    UI class or the turn pump, and `issue_cheat_ai_toggle` being a
    replicated command proves the AI is re-derived per client). So **a
    recording replays the AI by re-simulating it**, and the replay diff's
    score cannot pass player 0 on any match with an AI in it, no matter how
    good the order stream is. The queue used to imply otherwise.

    **In progress, 2026-08-24** — `docs/AI.md` is the handoff. The first
    reading is complete (the driver, the census, the step machine, the
    make list, the sites, the city AI, research, the market, the scripts;
    four readers' reports for the language, the 55 host functions and the
    two `create_*` producers, ratified in §11), `crates/sim/src/ai.rs`
    holds the driver's pure half and `crates/sim/src/bhs.rs` the script
    interpreter (`docs/DECISIONS.md` entry 20). The finding that reframes
    this item: **the skirmish AI's opening is the shipped `economic.bhs` /
    `defensive.bhs`**, run through the scripting VM at production step 1 —
    "scripted in the open" was righter than the queue knew, and "escape
    the 2002 VM" is answered by an interpreter of our own reading the
    scripts from the install. The oracle is unusually good: run7's first
    115 seconds are the script's decisions, frame by frame (§5).

    **The opening runs end to end, 2026-08-24 (second session).** Object
    numbers (`find_free`'s bands), a technology in the production queue,
    the `Lobby`, the 55 host functions (`ai_host.rs`), `produce_building`
    (`ai_place.rs`, `circle_init` rebuilt in integers), and the driver in
    `Sim::tick` (`ai_drive.rs`). **Pinned on run7**: at frame 2 the AI's
    city holds three citizens at 25/26/27 food, its library Written Word
    then City State, and one farm site numbered 2006 with a citizen
    ordered onto it — `defensive` steps 6, 7, 9, 10 in one call. Run6's
    unlinked unit-frames went 673 → **0**; run7's 6,543 → 1,970. A
    `LEADERS=9` run (run8) settled the personality and the script
    (`docs/ORACLE.md` corrected: `LEADERS` obeys the threshold). ~~Next:
    the census and the C++ producers (§12.1), the map's tile layer for
    the farm's exact tile, then the blind second reading.~~

    **The census and the C++ producers landed, 2026-08-24 (third
    session)** — seven modules by seven parallel Opus workers over a
    shared surface (`ai_census`, `ai_sites`, `ai_research`, `ai_units`,
    `ai_build`, `ai_make`, `ai_types`), every formula re-read against the
    decompile as it was written, **thirty-odd corrections to §2 recorded
    in `docs/AI.md` §14** for the second reading. Two oracles found on
    the way, each one ini line: **`WORLD=6` under `[Start Game]` dumps
    the map** (every cell's `val`/`goods`/`region`/owner and every
    tile's mask — run9; `rondata` loads it, and the AI's farm lands on
    the original's tile), and **`LEADERS=9` is the census** (run8/run9's
    frame 1 agrees with the sweep field for field, one ceiling: the
    woodcutter camp's `calc_gather` slots). ~~Next: run10 (this lobby,
    the map, run7's length) into the harness; the frame-0 sync stream
    (the map maker's draws — `compute_sites`' stride is on the wrong
    stream);~~

    **The sync stream is read out of a dump, 2026-08-24 (fourth
    session)** — `GameLog::say_checksum` is the setup path's own trace
    and prints `game_random seed` at `check_all_level=14` (`rise.ini`)
    with `[Misc Logging] CHECKSUM=2`; run11 is the capture
    (`docs/ORACLE.md`, "The setup path's checksum trace is the RNG
    state"). Every draw from the lobby seed to frame 0 is counted
    (`docs/ORDERS.md` §9.2), the AI's personality is exactly the twenty
    draws between `Leader::init`'s checkpoints and reproduces the
    original's block from its own state, and `build_sim` installs the
    frame-0 word. With it — and the terrain heights, which only a
    `DUMP_ALL` dump prints (run3; `World::tile_z`, the `find_tcoord_z`
    seam retired) — **run9's best city site is the original's
    `(52,14)/370`**, pinned. The same stream shows the next gap: the
    original draws **~120 times a frame** (units, herds, farms, ammo —
    run12's per-frame states), the sim's sweep twice, so the script's
    `rand_int`s at frame 1 land elsewhere and run10 scores 744 on the
    true stream (the 268 was a lucky branch on the sim's own). ~~Next: the
    per-frame draws (`docs/AI.md` §12.1 item 2′);~~

    **The per-frame draws are read, 2026-08-24 (fifth session)** —
    `docs/SYNC.md`: `Game::do_frame`'s order, every `game_random` site by
    phase, and run12's four frames attributed draw by draw by replaying
    the LCG against the dump's own outcomes — the market's flux values
    place its 18 draws at 2–19 and nowhere else, the 40 animals' idle-anim
    variants match at 48–87 with zero mismatches, the herd's step and the
    farms' sprout pin the tail. The steady six a frame is
    **`Farms::inc_time`**, one draw per complete farm — and it is the
    missing half of the farm clock, which retires `FARM_GROWS`: a farmed
    cell gets two `0.005f` adds a frame and single precision reaches
    `1.0f` on the 201st, so the farmer re-targets on the log's frame 102
    exactly as run6 measured. Landed: `market.rs` (the price cycle),
    `farms.rs` (the crop cells, integer adds with the two pinned
    crossings), `gaia.rs` (the birds' sampling, the herd walk, herds from
    a `DUMP_ALL` sibling), and the harness's `Built::tick`, which reads
    the per-frame words, installs them, and prints the count on both
    sides: **frame 0 ours 48 / theirs 120, frame 1 54 / 54, 6 / 6, 7 / 6**.
    Run7's first script call and run6's AI now take the original's branch
    (pinned); run10 holds 268 with `1/9` linking. Next: the 72 of frame 0
    — the idle-anim draw per unit with the art's animation lengths (a
    table from the dumps' `GUY` blocks), animals as gaia units with the
    wander, the scouts' `think_scout` scan (needs the seen map), the
    4-draw tail, frame 3's one extra `do_move` draw (`docs/SYNC.md` §6);
    ~~a `Checksum Dump`/`Break` frame-window capture~~ — **done the same
    day (run13, an Opus drive)**: the window is `LogStartFrame`/
    `LogEndFrame` in `rise2.ini`, and `gamelog-run13-window-95-105.txt`
    has sim-frames 95–103 at 23, 28, 7, 6, 8, 18, 21, 6, 6 draws; ~~read
    its `FRAME 102` block first — the 100/101 spikes fit the twelve
    animals whose anim ends at 101 and leave no room for the farmers'
    re-target draws where §6.5 puts them (`docs/SYNC.md` §6)~~ — **read,
    2026-08-24 (sixth session), and every one of the window's draws on
    99–103 is placed by outcome** (`docs/SYNC.md` §4.1): the twelve at 100
    are **animation wraps**, one `% 100` per guy whose idle animation ran
    out, and they live in `Objects::inc_time` → `Guy::inc_time` →
    `set_anim(CHAR_DEFAULT, 0, 1)` — phase 7, after every `process` and
    before the farms — not in `do_idle`; the twelve type-411 animals are
    `HERDFISH` in twelve schools, never herd members, so they never reach
    the wander roll; the farmers' re-target *is* on sim-frame 101 as §6.5
    said, and its modulus is **4**, not 3 (all six farmers' twelve draws
    match `% 4` and nothing else; `FARM_SPAN` landed with run13's pins in
    `farms.rs` and `diff.rs`); the unit loop's owner rotation
    (`(frame + i) % 10`) is now in `Sim::tick`, and the AI's three farmers'
    re-target goals match the dump. The harness takes run13 as a
    `--sibling` and prints the window: 98, 102, 103 match at 6/6; the gaps
    are the scout's scan (95–97), the trained citizen's two creation draws
    (99), the fish wraps (100) and the sheep's arrival plus the scout's
    wrap (101) — ~~so the next mechanic is **the animation clock** (every
    guy's `cur_time`/`end_time`, the wrap's draw, the lengths read from a
    dump's `GUY` blocks as an input), which is worth 14 of the window's 16
    missing draws~~ — **the animation clock landed, 2026-08-24 (seventh
    session)**, `docs/ANIM.md` and `crates/sim/src/anim.rs`: `UnitAnimCat`
    read out of the executable's `.rdata` (the idles are one category,
    the seven walks one, the attacks one — the category decides every
    branch), `Guy::set_anim`'s idle roll with its thresholds and its
    arrival test, `init_real`'s roll, `Guy::inc_time`'s step, wrap and
    mirror (a scout's dog copies guy 0 and never draws itself), the
    animals as units of owner 8 with `Animal::do_idle`'s wander, and the
    lengths and pieces as an `Art` input read out of the dumps (gaia's
    piece is `(seed + o) % 3`, a citizen's takes the gender bit `o & 1`;
    the loop flags in `anim_graphics.xml` turn out not to matter for an
    idle, since both restarts roll). The harness installs the clocks
    beside the words and skips a unit walking on one side only. **Window:
    98, 99, 100, 102, 103 exact** (99 the trained citizen's two, 100 the
    twelve fish), 101 20/21 (the sheep's walk), 95–97 the AI scout; with
    run12, **frame 0 is 96 of 120** (the forty animals, the scouts' four,
    the woodcutters' four — the 24 left are the scan, the explore path and
    the tail). `tools/gamelog/anims.py` reads the clocks. Open in its §9:
    the woodcutters' un-stepped frame 0 (neither `inside_up` nor
    `unit_masks2` — a `GUYS=4` capture), whether the dog rolls on the
    unit's request, the unobserved lengths (a `DUMP_ALL` window at
    108–125 shows the chop, sow and walk wraps; a BHA reader settles all),
    `think_farm_animal`. Next: **`think_scout`** (the scan and the
    re-target are now the whole of 95–97 and of frame 0's gap but the
    tail — it needs the seen map), the sheep's walk through the
    pathfinder, then the draw-site trace below; frame 0's 4-draw tail is
    *not* a wrap (`docs/SYNC.md` §6);
    `tools/gamelog/{passes,framediff,farms,draws,anims}.py` are the
    window's instruments; ~~**the draw-site trace** — a log-and-continue breakpoint on `Random::get` recording
    the caller's EIP under winedbg in the bottle (Wine's dbghelp reads
    `rise.pdb`, so the callers come out named), one run for frames 0–3,
    which is the only way to place the draws that leave no outcome in a
    dump (the scouts' 23, the tail's 4) and de-risks the whole of §6 —
    proposed by the `lore` session, 2026-08-24~~ — **done, 2026-08-24
    (eighth session), and not with winedbg: `tools/trace/`** is an
    in-process DLL loaded by a patched copy of the exe (no debugger, no
    install), which trampolines the four LCG-stepping sites (the fourth is
    `MathUtilFuncSet::rand_real`, the script VM's, inlined on
    `game_random`) and plants an `int 3` on all 48,233 function entries for
    **function coverage** — cumulative over a run and per frame in a
    window. Run14 reproduced run12/13's counts exactly and **placed every
    draw of frames 0–3 and 95–103 by site** (`docs/ORACLE.md`, "The
    draw-site trace and function coverage"): the scouts are 24 at three
    `think_scout` offsets, the tail's 4 are phase-7 wraps at 110–113 with
    the farms last, frame 3 is farms only. The coverage side answers the
    question the anim audit raised — which claims rest on the reading
    alone: **of the 423 functions `docs/` cites by address, 156 have never
    run in any traced game** (`report.py … blind docs/`) — attrition and
    supply, all of combat, the AI's C++ producers, every order but
    move/gather/build, the trade economy. That list is the queue of
    behavioural runs, each one a trace: a border crossing, a fight, a long
    game past the script, run7's order stream replayed under the trace.
    **The border crossing is run (run16, 2026-08-24, an Opus drive from a
    written brief):** the whole of attrition and supply observed, twelve
    predictions written before the log was read and all twelve seen — the
    periods 8/48/24/0, the sixteenths, **489 of 489 ticks on the
    `(frame + o) % period` grid**, the wagon's shelter with its `0x40000`
    flag in `unit_masks2`, the Nubian clause dead (`docs/ATTRITION.md` and
    `docs/SUPPLY.md`, last sections; `tools/gamelog/attr.py`). The blind
    list is 99. What the run cost is the loop — an hour of typing into a
    chat box that drops four lines in ten — so ~~the next build is the
    scripted cheat channel in `rontrace.dll`~~ **built the same night:
    `rontrace.cmd`** (`docs/ORACLE.md`, "The cheat channel"; `tools/trace/
    README.md`) — run16 replayed from twelve lines in twelve minutes,
    unattended, every line on its frame, `!quit` closing the game by the
    menu's path, and the sheltered-from-the-start case run16 never reached
    seen (run16b). A scenario is now a file; the speed floor is the dump
    (~3 frames a second at `UNITS=3`), so window it. ~~Next: run17,
    combat~~ — **run17 done the same night through the channel**
    (`docs/COMBAT.md` §16, `docs/ORACLE.md` "The combat run"): every
    unit-on-unit hit in 2,600 frames is a size the formula predicted
    before the log was read — 122 on a wagon from any bearing (CIVILIAN,
    no flank), 48/85/117 hoplite on hoplite, 32/58/85 slinger on hoplite,
    53 on a scout — the flank sectors settled by damage, the projectile
    draw sites named. The blind list is 95: the order commands other than
    move/gather/build, air, patrol/follow/guard, the group actions, and
    `is_fleeing` (a wagon's flight is something else). ~~**Next blind runs,
    each a file:** run7's order stream replayed under the trace (the
    command processors), a long game past the script (the AI's C++
    producers at `LEADERS=9` around a sweep)~~ — **the long game is run
    (run18, 2026-08-25)**, and it is the first dump that has ever shown
    this mechanic run: `docs/AI.md` §15, `docs/ORACLE.md` "The producers'
    run", `tools/gamelog/steps.py`. Nine predictions written first and all
    nine held — the script exits at sim-frame 6376 from `defensive`'s
    `case 29` (Classical Age *bought*, `ages_get()` still 0); the two step
    ladders are `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0` on the sweep the script dies on and
    `1,3,4,5,6,7,8,0` on every later one, frame for frame; the make list
    fills slots 0, 5 and 8 and nowhere else, which is `make_me`'s ranked
    four over `list[cat]` exactly; and **five expiry draws decide five
    slots by `% 3 == 0`** against the trace's own seeds, settling an arm
    §2.6's prose had backwards (`ai_make.rs` had it right — the pin fails
    if the prose is restored). The lever that made it cheap: **`ffwd` is a
    presentation switch the sim never reads**, so with the per-frame dump
    gated off (`LogStartFrame=0 LogEndFrame=0`) the sim runs at **~500
    frames a second, 35× real time** — 24,000 frames in 45 seconds. A run's
    whole cost is `dump blocks × ~2.4 s` (~1.7 MB each at `LEADERS=9`), so
    budget the window and fast-forward the rest. Blind list **95 → 89**.
    **run19 followed the same day**, 19 blocks and 90 seconds
    (`docs/AI.md` §15.6) — the window around frame
    8182, where the AI is in the Classical Age with a full make list: the
    **second pass** (steps 9–11, never seen before; `make_stuff` is
    `production_ai+0x1fa` at step 8 and `+0x236` at step 11), two purchases
    in one call, `research_techs` reaching the 9,999,999 overflow guard and
    drawing nothing, the runners-up shifting through slots 1–3, and a
    scholar **kept at a non-head slot and cleared at the head on the same
    `% 3` residue** — which isolates `expire_all`'s head clause from the
    probabilistic one on a single type. Nine expiry observations, nine
    agreeing. Still to run, each a file: run7's order stream replayed under
    the trace (the command processors), a mounted attacker for the cavalry
    flank reduction, a caravan, and a window at frame 576 for
    `found_cities`' purchases (which needs the script's caller told apart
    from the producer's by the dump's step). Then the AI queue below.
    Next for the AI: ~~fold §14 into §2~~ — **done, 2026-08-25**: the
    thirty-odd corrections the seven implementation workers found are now
    *in* §2 (the census's radius base and its two aliased locals, the
    make list's danger map — the same misreading in four places — the
    site insertion rule, the distance loop's `return`s, research's
    stockpile gates and inverted government polarity), and
    `create_units`/`create_buildings`/`produce_building` were **promoted
    to §2.18–§2.20** rather than folded, because §2 had never covered them
    at all; §14 is now a map of where each went. §2.9 lists what is still
    unread at document level (`upgrade_units`, `produce_unit`,
    `produce_upgrade`, `produce_spell`, `check_income`, `unit_prod_value`,
    `check_transport`).

    **The loader's half of the producers' seams landed, 2026-08-25** —
    `docs/DATALAYER.md`, "The derived words no column carries", and
    `crates/sim/src/ai_load.rs`. What made it cheap: **the type dump carries
    the derived words too.** `UnitType::log_data` prints `role`,
    `unit_flags` and `unit_flags2`; `BuildType::log_data` prints
    `build_flags`; `TechType::log_data` prints the **eleven `ai[scan]`
    weights**. So run3's `DUMP_ALL` dump is a field-by-field oracle for the
    whole item and `rondata --types <dump>` now reports **0 differences on
    all four** — 364 roles, 364 `unit_flags2`, 129 `build_flags`, 85 × 11
    weights, with the 493 × 493 combat table still 0 beside them. Landed:
    `UnitType::cols` (`determine_roles`, `init_final_flags`, and the caster
    bit `craftrules.xml` seeds and `init_spellcasters` walks down the graft
    chains), the six derived `build_flags` bits, `TypeDef::ai[11]`
    (`compute_ai_values` + `add_preq_ai`), and the seams in `ai_units.rs`
    and `ai_research.rs` closed behind them. Three corrections came with it,
    each one a claim the reading alone had wrong: **`build_flags &
    0x8000000` is live** — it is `TechType::set_research`'s mark, not a
    `BUILD_FLAGS` digit, so `create_buildings`' civic block is not dead code
    and `is_military_trainer` is not dead either (`docs/AI.md` §2.19); the
    build queue's capacity is **three-way, 20/10/2** (`docs/CITIES.md`); and
    the unit table has a **name group** — `Types::init` loads it in five
    passes and, from the third, gives a record whose `NAME` repeats the
    previous one's the *first* record of that run, so sixty-four records
    take another row's columns and four shipped rows (a General's `FLAGS`,
    Riflemen's `ARMOR`, two `LOS`, the Howitzer's `SPLASH_PERCENT`) are read
    past (`docs/FORMATS.md`).

    ~~Then: the blind second reading — which can run from any
    session, since the readers are subagents and only the *brief* must
    avoid leaking claims~~ — **done, 2026-08-25**, `docs/audit/
    2026-08-25-ai.md` and `docs/AI.md` §16. Seven blind readers on Opus 5 in
    two waves, adjudicated in the main thread; 590 claims, 42 doubly
    confirmed, 31 corrections, five of §13's open questions closed, **three
    corrections to `crates/sim`**: the coastal ring is centred on the
    original cell and not the slid one (which **neither** reading had — the
    document and the implementation were both wrong), difficulty 2 reads the
    *previous* age's stamp, and `Site::dist` carries the last enemy capital's
    quotient because the original clobbers the slot. The last of those was
    found by **widening the harness's `SITES` check from the best site to all
    ten records** — it failed on run9 the first time it ran, which is the
    cheapest correction the audit produced and the model for the rest.

    **Two things are owed and are not done:**

    1. **A guard for the ring fix (audit B4-k).** No capture on disk can
       meet it: the branch needs `world.sea_map > 2` and run9's map reports
       `sea_map 1`, so it is dead in every dump we have. It needs **a run on
       a many-islands map** — worth doing for its own sake, since the whole
       sea half of the AI (docks, transports, `check_transport`,
       `reg_naval` and B5-b's `% 63` aliasing) is on the trace's
       never-executed list.
    2. **Widen the make-list diff the way `SITES` was widened.** Audit B7-f:
       `LeaderData::log_data` dumps all eleven slots at `LEADERS=9` under
       `t val escrow city up o num cat wx wy`, so every §2.6/§2.11 claim is
       falsifiable from a capture we already have.

    **And the leak, which is the next session's first task**
    (`docs/DECISIONS.md` entry 21): a subagent inherits this file, and this
    file names the findings a blind reader is meant to re-derive — so the AI
    audit's protocol leaked, and every future one will unless the queue moves
    out of `CLAUDE.md` and into `docs/QUEUE.md`.

    `docs/audit/README.md` also owes a paragraph each to the
    pathfinder, commands and recgame audits it never got. And
    `gather_max` for non-flat buildings is **not** a seam after all:
    `BuildTypeData::calc_gather` is a thousand-line terrain scan with mining
    lists and cliff tests, so it is a mechanic of its own and belongs with
    `docs/ECONOMY.md`'s gathering.

## 2026-08-25 — the meta-docs, the AI audit's third pass, the method

Session "attrition" on Fable 5, after the AI audit's Opus session. No
simulation change; everything below is observed or is a decision.

- **The Opus 5 tranche stamped** (`9e123c0..abd365c`, eleven commits,
  ~4,100 lines). The three verdicts that changed `crates/sim` re-verified
  from their own citations: the coastal ring's centre from
  `compute_site_stats` lines 233–234 and 253–254, `Site::dist` from
  `local_34`'s three writers, the difficulty-2 stamp from the listing at
  `0x6c6e94`/`0x6c6eac` and `TypeData::is_age_type` at vtable `+0x34`.
  Nothing retracted. `cargo test` 492 + 82 + 3 + 3 with the install
  attached, 0 ignored; clippy and fmt clean; `rondata --types` against
  run3 39 checks, 0 differences. Recorded as `docs/audit/2026-08-25-ai.md`,
  "Third pass".
- **The queue left `CLAUDE.md`.** `57546c0` the verbatim move (847 → 304
  lines); `caf6bf4` the rules stripped of the findings they cited as
  examples (288), with one rule added — this file must never name what a
  blind reader is meant to re-derive. Decision 21 executed.
- **The verification split agreed with the user** and written as a rule
  (`746bb26`): diff first wherever a dump exists; a blind reading scoped to
  what no run reaches, its readers briefed to output assertions; the soak a
  determinism guard, never fidelity. Item 13 — differential fuzzing against
  the original, the soak's generator through the cheat channel into the
  harness's diff — added with a brief that says what must become true first.
- **Lore's review** of the layout (the meta/wiki session, answering from its
  corpus of other repositories' continuity files): one queue file is right
  *on the condition* that a struck entry is one line and a pointer, which is
  how `CLAUDE.md` reached 847; the chronicle belongs in a dated append-only
  journal, this file; the model split belongs in git, not in a memory file;
  a file map with an inherited-by-subagents column; a "last verified"
  banner and a literal opener on the handoff. All adopted, in `docs/
  QUEUE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, decision 22 and `docs/audit/README.md`.
- **Checked, not assumed:** whether a subagent inherits the memory
  directory as well as `CLAUDE.md`. A probe agent on Haiku, told to read
  nothing, quoted the memory index's bullet lines verbatim — so **the index
  is inherited, hooks and all**, and is a second leak surface the
  `CLAUDE.md` cut had not closed. Its hooks are now finding-free, and the
  two memory files that duplicated `docs/ORACLE.md` are deleted.

## 2026-08-25 — the make list diffed whole (owed item 1)

Session on Fable 5, the queue's opener taken as written. One sim change,
one guard, two document corrections.

- **The widening.** Not the best slot but the window: every consecutive
  pair of `LEADERS=9` blocks in run18b (216) and run19 (18), all eleven
  `MAKEOBJECT`s × ten fields, each step of the production ladder replayed
  with the sim's own `clear` / `make_me` / `expire` on the previous record
  and compared to the next; the frames each class covers asserted so the
  test cannot pass by calling everything unchanged. Run9's frame 1 pinned
  to the init record beside the census. `docs/AI.md` §15.7.
- **What it found.** `MakeList::clear@006c9db0` rewrites the whole record
  (`val −1`, `num 1`, the rest cleared) and `Array<MakeObject>::init`
  fills the same; the sim cleared `t` alone with `val 0, num 0` behind it.
  Behavioural, not cosmetic: the first sweep's citizen is offered at
  **`val 0`** — §15.2 had copied the second sweep's 714 onto it — and
  lands only because `−1 < 0`. Corrected in `ai.rs`; the guard was run
  against the old `clear` first and failed at dump-frame 6577 naming the
  three stale `val`s. Also read off the replay: `research_techs` must
  offer its cat-8 line first (two of 24 orders reproduce 8179); step 9's
  `create_units` offered a merchant the end state hides, overwritten at
  the head by a scholar at `num 5`; the expiry writes `t` alone and its
  ghost records travel intact through `make_me`'s shift.
- **The method note.** Second time running that a whole-record diff found
  in twenty minutes what a reading had passed twice (`SITES` was the
  first). Both were *predicates on the empty case* — what a cleared slot
  holds, what an unscored site's `dist` holds — which a fixture built from
  the same reading cannot see because the fixture's empty is the
  reading's empty.
- `cargo test --workspace` with the install 492 + 83 + 13 + 3, 0 ignored;
  clippy and fmt clean; `rondata` survey exits 0. One `ai_make`
  fixture had leaned on `num 0` making `can_pay` vacuous and was given a
  purse.

## 2026-08-25 — the `--types` check as a test (owed item 1, the second)

Session on Fable 5, the queue's opener taken as written. No simulation
change; one guard moved from a flag to a test.

- **What was wrong.** `rondata --types <dump>` compared twenty things —
  the loader's 364 unit and 129 building `Kind`s field by field, the four
  derived words, the 85 techs' eleven weights, the whole 493 × 493 table —
  and only ran when someone passed the flag. The definition of done's
  `cargo run -p rondata -- <install>` never reached it, so the guard for
  `docs/COMBAT.md` §5 and `docs/DATALAYER.md`'s derived words could lapse
  by omission and had no way of saying so.
- **The move.** The comparison left the binary for the library
  (`rondata::typesdump::compare`, returning a report of notes and checks
  rather than printing); the CLI prints that report, unchanged to the
  character (39 `[ok]`, the same 20 under `--types`). The test
  `typesdump::tests::run3_s_type_dump_is_the_program_s_on_every_check`
  reads run3's 152 MB dump with the streaming reader in ~5 s, asserts the
  dump's shape first (364, 129, 85, the table present — so a dump with
  nothing to check cannot pass), then that all twenty checks hold. The
  install and dump helpers the `SITES` pin and the `load.rs` tests each
  carried are now one `testenv` module in `lib.rs`.
- **Made to fail once.** The loader's siege predicate flipped from
  `0x20000` to `0x10000`: the test named the 16 siege units and 3,664
  table cells, then was restored. The first run also failed on its own
  pin — the check count was written as 24 and is 20 — which is the pin
  doing its job on the author.
- `cargo test --workspace` with the install 492 + 84 + 13 + 3, 0 ignored;
  clippy and fmt clean; `rondata` survey exits 0; `--types` against run3
  39 checks, 0 differences.

## 2026-08-25 — the audit README's three missing paragraphs (owed item 1, the third)

Session on Fable 5, the queue's opener taken as written. Documents only.

- **What was owed.** `docs/audit/README.md`'s record narrated every second
  reading from the first pass through the AI, except three it named in a
  placeholder at the end: the pathfinder (2026-08-23), the recorded-game
  container and the command payload encoding (both 2026-08-24). Each had
  its audit file; none had its paragraph in the method's record.
- **Written**, from the audit files, the journal's struck entries 8–10 and
  the commit trailers (all three adjudications on Fable in the main
  thread; the blind readers Opus 5). In date order between the orders
  ratification and the animation clock. What each paragraph keeps: the
  pathfinder's lesson that a flag left uninterpreted by both readings was
  already settled in `docs/ORDERS.md` §8; the container's package-stream
  start reached by two algorithms with no shared code, and its correction
  in the writers (raw, gzipped only in `finalize`); the commands audit's
  three corrections of one kind — what can actually be emitted — settled
  by sweeping every `add_command` caller. And one thing the record had not
  said: the recgame and commands blind reports were lost with the job's
  tmp, against the orders audit's own third lesson; the pathfinder's are
  at `~/ghidra-projects/reports/pathfinder/`, one directory over from
  `reading/`.
- The placeholder removed; the queue's owed list down to two.

## 2026-08-25 — the islands map: B4-k's guard, and four things it was hiding (owed item 1, the last)

On Fable, with the user at the machine (the lobby's three clicks and a
combo were driven by `cliclick`; nothing else needed a hand). The owed
item said "a many-islands run through the cheat channel, then the B4-k
assertion", and that is what happened, but the assertion took four
corrections to `crates/sim` to pass, and only one of them was about the
ring.

- **Run20** — East Indies under `DUMP_ALL` for frames 0–3, its own setup
  trace, heights, herds and fog; seven minutes. **Run21** — the same lobby,
  dump off, `!ffwd` to 24,000; two minutes. `docs/ORACLE.md`, "run20 and
  run21". The map style could not be set from `check.ini` (never could —
  every earlier run was Great Lakes, not the Sahara the file named) and
  Save to Profile did not outlive a killed process; the combo was clicked
  both times.
- **The guard**: `run20_s_islands_sites_walk_the_coastal_ring_from_the_
  original_cell`, the ten-record `SITES` diff plus the per-region census
  for *every* region. It passes; with the ring re-centred on the slid cell
  it moves the record by a slot. `docs/AI.md` §15.8, the audit's fourth
  pass.
- **What it was hiding**, each found by the diff failing and settled at
  its own citation: `world+0x34` is the map style's `SEA_MAP` class (0–4),
  not a landmass count — every reader in `crates/sim` renamed, and the
  document's five "landmasses" glosses corrected; `land_key[]` is the
  static `BASELAND, SANDY, OCEAN, NONE`, and the harness's first-appearance
  numbering had been right on run9 by luck; `is_ocean` is by cell kind;
  and `was_seen` is not a seam — it has a territory arm (an ally's cell in
  a region with cities or forts is seen unfogged) that the dump's fog grid
  alone cannot reproduce, and without which the sim scored no site at all.
  The fog grid is now loaded from the WORLD dump and the arm is in
  `ai_sites.rs`.
- **The blind list, 92 → 87** over ten traces — and the discovery that
  the sea half run21 lit up (`check_transport`, the docks,
  `Army::do_transporting`) was invisible to it, because §9 cites those
  functions without an address. Named by address now.
- **The one loose end, pulled the same evening** at the user's prompt
  ("file it or fix it?"): the world's `sea_map 4` on a style whose file
  says 3. The first writer search had grepped for one pointer name;
  `World::analyze_map` stores through another, and its rule — starts on
  separate landmasses and the free islands holding twice the players'
  land promote a 3 to 4 — reproduces run20's 4 from the dump's own region
  sizes (1097 ≥ 1058). Twenty minutes, and the reason to do it before
  `/clear`: the decompile paths, the string-table decoder and run21's
  setup trace were all still in hand.
- **Open, honestly**: `reg_forts` and `was_seen`'s leader-flag exits
  unmodelled; the sea half read by no one yet.
- The queue's owed list is empty. Item 12 is done.
