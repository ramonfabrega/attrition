# Parked

The backlog that does not boot. `docs/QUEUE.md` holds what is in flight and
what is next; this holds everything else, and **a fresh session does not read
it** — the queue's opener is what starts a session, and this file is opened
when a *wave is composed*, which is a different and rarer moment (item 263,
decided 2026-09-07 with Ramon and lore).

Two rules ride with that, and they are the conditions the split was agreed
under:

- **Read this when composing a wave, not at boot.** Once per wave is cheap;
  once per session was the cost being removed.
- **A cross-item constraint does not park.** If an item says something a
  worker on *another* item must obey — that a file is about to be split,
  that a mechanism cannot move a scored word — it is stated in that
  worker's brief, or the item is promoted back to the queue. Two workers in
  one file is the failure this split would otherwise buy.

Numbers here are live: `tools/queueledger.py` reads this file alongside the
queue, so moving an item between the two is not a deletion and never reads
as one. Everything in `docs/QUEUE.md`'s "How to maintain this file" applies
here too, except the item cap — a parked item is not an open one.

## Measured residues, none near a word

(246) step 6's repath rests on run83's single event (239); (169)
`compute_site_stats`, 7,122 of run63's 27,000 site fields; (172) the
`bucket` pair on 5002/5061; (158) the human-leader sweep (AI §23.1); (159)
the `CITY` record's two seams; (146) `train_time`'s nine national arms;
(142) `World::tregion` (PATHFINDER §15–16); (122) 16 of 61 draws without a
`self.mark(`; (153) `TRIBE`; (20) the `Census` rows; (23) the formation
byte's sign, Echelon half (GROUPS §6.4), run52 the blocker; (103) a
woodcutter's clock, 445 v 480 (ORDERS §6.4); (105/45) Gaia's positions,
first bad 1658 (SYNC §4.2); (124) the loop flag is per animation file;
(116) the one `SITE` slot (AI §18); (166) `resource_cap` on five goods
(ECONOMY); (107) `epoch[0]`.

## Older backlog

(39) a 2D viewer over `Sim`; (41) `scenario.py`; a `find_target` block;
run7's orders; a mounted attacker; `calc_gather` non-flat;
`Leader::diplomacy`; (77) ANIM §3.2; (58) ROADS §7.4.
