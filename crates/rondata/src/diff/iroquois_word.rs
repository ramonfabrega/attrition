//! Lakes (`MAP_STYLE 14`), human Nubians (4) against **the Iroquois (18)**
//! at Difficulty 3, seed 12345 — `docs/AI.md` §243's third lobby, scored by
//! its first try at 0 of 12,658 and promoted out of the battery here, so it
//! is a scored lobby from this item (`battery::SCORED_LOBBIES`) and no
//! longer held out. Captures: run897 (a `DUMP_ALL` start, blocks 1, 36 and
//! 37) and run897b (the draw stream to the game's end, `cover=0`, its setup
//! and closing blocks only); the word's window is run897's own block 1
//! (`docs/AI.md` §246).
