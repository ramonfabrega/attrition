//! The gamelog diff: the original's per-frame dump against the simulation.
//!
//! Phase 3's score is ticks before divergence. This is the harness that
//! produces it: [`build_sim`] stands a `sim::Sim` up from a start-of-game
//! dump ([`crate::gamelog::Initial`]) with the loaded types
//! ([`crate::load::Loaded`]), and [`run`] steps it frame by frame against the
//! dump's `FRAME n` blocks, comparing what both sides hold.
//!
//! # What it can see today, and what it cannot
//!
//! At detail level 0 the original writes, per unit per frame, the object base
//! — owner, object number, `x_internal`/`y_internal`/`z_internal` — and per
//! leader its `score` and flags. So the comparison is **positions of units
//! keyed by `(who, o)`**, and the score is reported but not matched (the
//! simulation has no score yet). The per-frame `GUY` blocks are empty, the
//! leaders carry no goods, and buildings are not written per frame under the
//! categories the logged runs enabled; `DUMP_ALL=1` is the untried lever for
//! more (`docs/ORACLE.md`).
//!
//! And the simulation has no AI and sees no orders: in the logged runs the
//! human's units stand still and the AI's move as soon as it decides to, so
//! the honest expectation is that player 0 matches for as long as the human
//! did nothing and the AI player diverges the frame its first order lands.
//! That is still worth running — it proves the ids, the types, the world
//! scale and the step cadence agree end to end — and it is the scaffold the
//! order stream plugs into when the recorded-game container is read.
